# ⚡ ThorDrive

A modular, open-source platform for developing **inverters**, **controllers**, and **embedded firmware** for electric vehicle applications.  
Built with robust engineering principles and driven by passion.

Maintained by **Omar Magdy** for the **Cairo University Eco Racing Team**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

ThorDrive implements a range of hardware and software solutions for electric drive systems.  
It includes:

- Custom inverters (multi-phase and bidirectional support)
- Firmware for Trapezoidal , FOC, SPWM, SVM, and advanced motor control
- Modular controllers and drivers
- Fully documented software and hardware stacks
- Design iterations built for real-world racing

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Multiple Inverter Designs**
- 🧾 **Well-documented Firmware** using Doxygen
- 💡 **Modular & Scalable Design** across generations
- 🛠️ **Interactive BOMs and Fabrication-Ready Gerbers**
- 🔧 **Configurable Build System** for firmware
- 💻 **Simulator & HIL Support**
- 🧪 **Validated by Real-World Team Use**

Specific features are documented in each design subfolder:


## 🛠️ Get Started

1. **Navigate to a Design Folder**  
   Visit:
   - `ThorDrive_FW/<DesignName_and_Version>/README.md`
   - `ThorDrive_HW/<DesignName_and_Version>/README.md`

2. **Build Software / Flash Firmware**  
   Follow platform-specific build instructions in each firmware README.

3. **Hardware Fabrication**  
   - Use provided **Gerber** files for PCB manufacturing.
   - Access **Interactive BOM** from each hardware directory.
